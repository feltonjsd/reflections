When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you need to work on different machines or when multiple people are working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because you may not want all of the latest changes and this may cause merge errors as you are working on files which may have been updated on the remote repository
